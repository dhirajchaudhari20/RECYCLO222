                 Our project is been designed with the view to solve this problem. One of the main reason that there is so much improper management of of these waste is lack of knowledge that how to recycle them. We in our project are going to make the people aware about this and also will help them to reach to the right person to sell it. It is a business in the sense which will encourage people to recycle garbage. In this the companies which produce large amount of recyclable waste will also find the right buyers to do so. The project will be great sucess as ethical as well as the business perspective as the recycling industry in India is already of the worth 15 million dollar. This app will make more money to both buyer's as well as sellers
